            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
              Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵, c. 1584 – 13 June 1645),[1] also known
              as Shinmen Takezō, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name,
              Niten Dōraku,[2] was a Japanese swordsman, philosopher, strategist,
              writer and rōnin, who became renowned through stories of his unique
              double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 61 duels
              (next is 33 by Itō Ittōsai). Musashi, as he was often simply known,
              is considered a Kensei, a sword-saint of Japan.[3] He was the
              founder of the Niten Ichi-ryū, or Nito Ichi-ryū, style of
              swordsmanship, and in his final years authored The Book of Five
              Rings (五輪の書, Go Rin No Sho) and Dokkōdō (獨行道, The Path of
              Aloneness).<br />
              Both documents were given to Terao Magonojō, the most important of
              Musashi's students, seven days before Musashi's death. The Book of
              Five Rings deals primarily with the character of his Niten Ichi-ryū
              school in a concrete sense, i.e., his own practical martial art and
              its generic significance; The Path of Aloneness, on the other hand,
              deals with the ideas that lie behind it, as well as his life's
              philosophy in a few short aphoristic sentences. <br />The Miyamoto
              Musashi Budokan training center, located in Ōhara-chō (Mimasaka),
              Okayama prefecture, Japan was erected to honor his name and legend.

            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              In Musashi's last book, The Book of Five Rings (五輪書, Go Rin no
              Sho), Musashi seems to take a very philosophical approach to looking
              at the "craft of war": "There are five ways in which men pass
              through life: as gentlemen, warriors, farmers, artisans and
              merchants."<br />
              Throughout the book, Musashi implies that the way of the Warrior, as
              well as the meaning of a "true strategist" is that of somebody who
              has made mastery of many art forms away from that of the sword, such
              as tea drinking (sadō), laboring, writing, and painting, as Musashi
              practiced throughout his life.[33] Musashi was hailed as an
              extraordinary sumi-e artist in the use of ink monochrome as depicted
              in two such paintings: "Shrike Perched in a Dead Tree" (Koboku
              Meigekizu, 枯木鳴鵙図) and "Wild Geese Among Reeds" (Rozanzu,
              魯山図). Going back to the Book of Five Rings, Musashi talks deeply
              about the ways of Buddhism.<br />
              He makes particular note of artisans and foremen. When he wrote the
              book, the majority of houses in Japan were made of wood. In the use
              of building a house, foremen have to employ strategy based upon the
              skill and ability of their workers.<br />
              In comparison to warriors and soldiers, Musashi notes the ways in
              which the artisans thrive through events; the ruin of houses, the
              splendor of houses, the style of the house, the tradition and name
              or origins of a house. These too, are similar to the events which
              are seen to have warriors and soldiers thrive; the rise and fall of
              prefectures, countries and other such events are what make uses for
              warriors, as well as the literal comparisons: "The carpenter uses a
              master plan of the building, and the way of strategy is similar in
              that there is a plan of campaign".

            <h2>In Popular Culture</h2>
            <p>
              Even in Musashi's time there were fictional texts resembling comic
              books. It is therefore quite difficult to separate fact from fiction
              when discussing his life. There have been numerous works of fiction
              made about or featuring Musashi. Eiji Yoshikawa's novelization
              (originally a 1930s daily newspaper serial) has greatly influenced
              successive fictional depictions (including the manga Vagabond by
              Takehiko Inoue) and is often mistaken for a factual account of
              Musashi's life. In 2012, writer Sean Michael Wilson and Japanese
              artist Chie Kutsuwada published an attempt at a more historically
              accurate manga entitled The Book of Five Rings: A Graphic Novel,
              based on research and translations by William Scott Wilson.
              Onimusha, a video game series by Capcom, featured Musashi as a
              secret playable character in Onimusha Blade Warriors. The 2008 video
              game Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan! was based on his life and personality. He
              also appeared in the manga Baki-Dou as a revived clone of himself
              with his real soul intact as one of the strongest fighters in the
              series, and used his two-sword style in almost every combat in which
              he was shown. In the video game Overwatch the playable character
              Genji used to have a voice line that quotes Musashi: "Mi wo sutetemo
              myōri wa sutezu" (身を捨てても名利は捨てず), which roughly
              translates to "You may abandon your body, but you must preserve your
              honor." The card game Magic: The Gathering has a card based on him,
              Isshin, Two Heavens as One, named for his two swords as one
              technique. In the 2017 video game For Honor, the "Aramusha" hero is
              loosely inspired by Musashi. The character is a ronin who wields two
              swords. In Cyberpunk 2077 the character Takemura sends a text
              message to V that reads "Even should you abandon your body, never
              abandon your honor. Never stray from the Way. Miyamoto Musashi" This
              text can only be received after the mission Search and Destroy, if
              the player saves Takemura. The 2023 anime Onimusha was based loosely
              on the video game franchise of the same name and produced by
              Netflix. The series portrays a fictional version of an aging Musashi
              who embarks on a journey to defeat supernatural forces of evil using
              the Oni Gauntlet.
