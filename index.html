        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Miyamoto Musashi (宮本 武蔵, c.1584 - 13 June 1645),[1] also known
          as Shinmen Takezō, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name,
          Niten Dōraku,[2] was a Japanese swordsman, philosopher, strategist,
          writer and rōnin, who became renowned through stories of his unique
          double-bladed swordsmanship and undefeated record in his 61 duels
          (next is 33 by Itō Ittōsai). Musashi, as he was often simply known,
          is considered a Kensei, a sword-saint of Japan.[3] He was the
          founder of the Niten Ichi-ryū, or Nito Ichi-ryū, style of
          swordsmanship, and in his final years authored The Book of Five
          Rings (五輪の書, Go Rin No Sho) and Dokkōdō (獨行道, The Path of
          Aloneness).<br />
          Both documents were given to Terao Magonojō, the most important of
          Musashi's students, seven days before Musashi's death. The Book of
          Five Rings deals primarily with the character of his Niten Ichi-ryū
          school in a concrete sense, i.e., his own practical martial art and
          its generic significance; The Path of Aloneness, on the other hand,
          deals with the ideas that lie behind it, as well as his life's
          philosophy in a few short aphoristic sentences. <br />The Miyamoto
          Musashi Budokan training center, located in Ōhara-chō (Mimasaka),
          Okayama prefecture, Japan was erected to honor his name and legend.

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          In Musashi's last book, The Book of Five Rings (五輪書, Go Rin no
          Sho), Musashi seems to take a very philosophical approach to looking
          at the "craft of war": "There are five ways in which men pass
          through life: as gentlemen, warriors, farmers, artisans and
          merchants."<br />
          Throughout the book, Musashi implies that the way of the Warrior, as
          well as the meaning of a "true strategist" is that of somebody who
          has made mastery of many art forms away from that of the sword, such
          as tea drinking (sadō), laboring, writing, and painting, as Musashi
          practiced throughout his life.[33] Musashi was hailed as an
          extraordinary sumi-e artist in the use of ink monochrome as depicted
          in two such paintings: "Shrike Perched in a Dead Tree" (Koboku
          Meigekizu, 枯木鳴鵙図) and "Wild Geese Among Reeds" (Rozanzu,
          魯山図). Going back to the Book of Five Rings, Musashi talks deeply
          about the ways of Buddhism.<br />
          He makes particular note of artisans and foremen. When he wrote the
          book, the majority of houses in Japan were made of wood. In the use
          of building a house, foremen have to employ strategy based upon the
          skill and ability of their workers.<br />
          In comparison to warriors and soldiers, Musashi notes the ways in
          which the artisans thrive through events; the ruin of houses, the
          splendor of houses, the style of the house, the tradition and name
          or origins of a house. These too, are similar to the events which
          are seen to have warriors and soldiers thrive; the rise and fall of
          prefectures, countries and other such events are what make uses for
          warriors, as well as the literal comparisons: "The carpenter uses a
          master plan of the building, and the way of strategy is similar in
          that there is a plan of campaign".

        <h2>In Popular Culture</h2>
        <p>
          Even in Musashi's time there were fictional texts resembling comic
          books. It is therefore quite difficult to separate fact from fiction
          when discussing his life. There have been numerous works of fiction
          made about or featuring Musashi. Eiji Yoshikawa's novelization
          (originally a 1930s daily newspaper serial) has greatly influenced
          successive fictional depictions (including the manga Vagabond by
          Takehiko Inoue) and is often mistaken for a factual account of
          Musashi's life. In 2012, writer Sean Michael Wilson and Japanese
          artist Chie Kutsuwada published an attempt at a more historically
          accurate manga entitled The Book of Five Rings: A Graphic Novel,
          based on research and translations by William Scott Wilson.
          Onimusha, a video game series by Capcom, featured Musashi as a
          secret playable character in Onimusha Blade Warriors. The 2008 video
          game Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan! was based on his life and personality. He
          also appeared in the manga Baki-Dou as a revived clone of himself
          with his real soul intact as one of the strongest fighters in the
          series, and used his two-sword style in almost every combat in which
          he was shown. In the video game Overwatch the playable character
          Genji used to have a voice line that quotes Musashi: "Mi wo sutetemo
          myōri wa sutezu" (身を捨てても名利は捨てず), which roughly
          translates to "You may abandon your body, but you must preserve your
          honor." The card game Magic: The Gathering has a card based on him,
          Isshin, Two Heavens as One, named for his two swords as one
          technique. In the 2017 video game For Honor, the "Aramusha" hero is
          loosely inspired by Musashi. The character is a ronin who wields two
          swords. In Cyberpunk 2077 the character Takemura sends a text
          message to V that reads "Even should you abandon your body, never
          abandon your honor. Never stray from the Way. Miyamoto Musashi" This
          text can only be received after the mission Search and Destroy, if
          the player saves Takemura. The 2023 anime Onimusha was based loosely
          on the video game franchise of the same name and produced by
          Netflix. The series portrays a fictional version of an aging Musashi
          who embarks on a journey to defeat supernatural forces of evil using
          the Oni Gauntlet.
