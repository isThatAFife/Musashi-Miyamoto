        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 class="hleft"><em>Early Life and Childhood</em></h3>
        <p>
          Musashi Sensei, or Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara no Genshin, as he introduces himself in the Preface of The
          Book of the Five Rings, was born in the Harima County during a very turbulent time in Japan, when the last
          decisive battles took place at that Samurai Gold Era.</p>

        <p>Back to that time in Japan, it was very common that a same individual changed his or her name during
          different
          periods of his/her own life (as we usually do with nicknames and spouse/married names versus single/maid names
          nowadays). During his childhood, Musashi Sensei was called the Shinmen Bennosuke. It is assumed that he
          received his first instructions on kenjutsu from his own father, Shinmen Hirata Munisai.</p>

        <p>As we can read in The Book of the Five Rings, he describes us the details of his first duel when he was with
          13 years old only. At his 16, he defeated a very skillful warrior named Tadashima Akiyama.
        </p>
        <h3 class="hright"><em>The battle of Sekigahara and the Kyoto Duels</em></h3>
        <p>
          On 1600 the Battle of Sekigahara took place, defining the destiny of Japan for the following 3 centuries. It
          was in this battle that Tokugawa Ieyasu ascended to power, assuming the Shogunduties - it was the beginning of
          the Edo Period (1603-1868). Musashi Sensei spent his youth during this chaotic early Edo Period. Historical
          credits recount that he fought on the side of a defeated Daimiô and Warlord, Ukita Hideie, along with the
          defeated army in the Sekigahara Battle. Despite the negative results on the battlefield, he was able to
          survive and scape from the bounty hunters of that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 1604, at 21 years of age, Musashi Sensei appears in Kyoto and his fame is spread for all over Japan after
          he defeated three important duels against three members of the illustrious Yoshioka Family, which was
          responsible, years before, for the instruction of House of shogun Ashikaga. (a kind of “official Swordsman
          School” for the Shogun himself).
        </p>
        <p>
          He embraced on three duels. In the first two he defeated the “Kenpo Brothers”, Seijuro and Denshijiro. After
          having defeated both, Yoshioka followers saw Musashi Sensei not as a simple opponent anymore, but as a true
          and alive threat. They seek for a revenge and arranged a third duel against Matashichiro, Seijuro's son, a 13
          years old kid. Matashchiro would count with the help and support of all students and followers of Yoshioka
          School. It is recalled that during this duel, Musashi Sensei fought against 60 opponents at the same time, all
          of them armed with swords, spears, bows and arrows and even muskets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Musashi Sensei defeated all his opponents, including Matashichiro and the Yoshioka's students who crossed his
          path on that day. This was the end of a once upon time proud Yoshioka House and the start of the Miyamoto
          Musashi's legend.

        <h3 class="hleft"><em>Warrior Peregrination</em></h3>
        <p>
          During the following years, Musashi Sensei kept traveling throughout the whole Japan as a Musha Shugyo - the
          warrior peregrination searching for duels. He faced many challengers, mainly after his fame spread due to the
          victories against the Yoshiokas. During this period we must stress the following duels:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Hozoin Temple Warrior Monks, famous for their Sojutsu (or Yarijutsu) School (spear techniques);</li>
          <li>Muso Gonnosuke, the founder of the Jojutsu (Staff techniques) Shindo Muso Ryu, a technique also trained in
            the Niten Institut. Gonnosuke created the Jojutsu after being defeated by Musashi Sensei as a way to defeat
            him. There is a long tradition recalling about a possible second duel against Musashi Sensei, where
            Gonnosuke had reached a tied combat, with no winner declared;</li>
          <li>Shishido Baiken, a kusarigama (a chain-sickle weapon) specialist. The kusarigama (a sickle with a metal
            chain with a heavy iron weight at the end) is a very exotic weapon and very hard to handle as well, which is
            also trained in some styles at the Niten Institut.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3 class="hright"><em>The Duel against Sasaki Kojiro</em></h3>
        <p>
          This is the most relevant and important duel fought by Musashi Sensei, which took place on 1612 when he
          defeated Sasaki Kojiro, the Ganryu School founder and a famous skilled samurai. Kojiro's skills remark him as
          one of the most respected samurais of all times.
          Afar from Musashi Sensei, who developed his own School based on his particular duel experiences, Kojiro was
          the follower of a long and extremely respected lineage and tradition. He studied Swordsmanship with the
          eminent Master Toda Seigen, from the Chujo Ryu School and Kenemaki Jisai, his disciple. Jisai was the master
          of the well-known and respected Swordmaster Itto Itosai, the founder of the famous Itto Ryu, one of the most
          important Swordsmanship styles of all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the duel time, Kojiro was the Hosokawa Tadaoki instructor, a very important Daimiô (a Feudal Lord).
          Musashi Sensei obtained permission to duel against Kojiro throughout Nagaoka Sado, an old friend of his family
          who was a long time advisor to Lord Hosokawa.
          The duel took place at the Funajima Island. Musashi Sensei's strategy for this duel was to deliberately delay
          the fight at the maximum point possible and keep the challenger in a long wait. Two hours after of the
          appointed time, he appeared in the shore and stroke directly his opponent in one single movement. Musashi
          Sensei also knew that Kojiro used an extralong sword and used to take advantage of the long distance while
          using his weapon. In order to cancel this length advantage, Musashi Sensei sculpted a longer wooden bokken in
          a broken paddle during his travel to the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fight was very quick and intense. Both stroke each other simultaneously. Musashi Sensei hit Kojiro front
          forehead with a very keen and precise movement. It is recalled that Kojiro strike reached the headscarf
          Musashi Sensei was using, causing a small incision in his fronthead. After Kojiro's fall, he tried a second
          and final strike while on the floor, aiming to hit Musashi Sensei's legs, who leaped to avoid this final
          strike, hitting Kojiro on the hips, with an instant fatal knock out that costed Kojiro's life.
          This is the description, according to witnesses recalls, of what must had happened during the most famous and
          celebrated duel of Samurai history and recollections.
        </p>
        <div class="duelimage">
          <img class="responsive" src="assets/images/ganryujima.webp" alt="Duel at Ganryujima island">
        </div>
        <p>
          During that time, Musashi Sensei was near his 30s. The duel against Kojiro had a huge effect over Musashi
          Sensei's mind. According with Musashi Sensei's own recollections on the Book of the Five Rings (Gorin No Sho),
          he reflected about all his victories reached so far, but was not able to find out why he defeated so many
          duels. Was that due to his physical strength? Or was that due to the weakness of his opponents? Or, maybe, was
          that due a God's will?
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking forward from the start point of these questions, Musashi Sensei spent the rest of his life - more than
          the two remaining thirds of his journey in Earth, in search for answers. So, he dedicated himself to leave for
          the following generations his legacy throughout his techniques that he baptized as Niten Ichi Ryu.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this time he got in contact with other artistic forms, such as painting, sculpture, poetry and even
          architecture and urbanism.

            <h3 class="hleft"><em>Mature Life</em></h3>
            <p>
              On 1621, Musashi Sensei held a legendary duel, but it was not because of his challenger, but mainly
              because
              this was the first official record of a two sword duel that became his trademark at Hyoho Niten Ichi Ryu.
              Miyaki Gunbei was his opponent, who tried to strike Musashi Sensei several times in a roll, being blocked
              in
              each one of the failed tentative. Gunbei desperately stroke a direct stab, blocked by the short sword
              carried
              on the left hand by Musashi Sensei, simultaneously to a direct attack over Gunbei's front face with the
              long
              sword carried by Musashi Sensei's right hand. Gunbei recognized that he lost the duel and ask deep
              apologies
              to Musashi Sensei, bowing to him and asking to become his disciple.
            </p>
            <p>
              Musashi Sensei did not marry, but adopted two kids, Mikinosuke and Iori. Both became vassals of important
              Feudal Lords.
            </p>
            <p>
              Musashi Sensei was not a simple ronin. He was considered a Master of the Way and a person with great
              sensibility and wisdom, an advisor to be always listened and a Leader to be followed. He was often invited
              to
              stay on Castles and had in his inner circle the trust of respected personalities, as Takuan Soho Monk (an
              advisor for the Tokugawa Shogun), Honami Koetsu (a very important celebrity of the artistic movement
              called
              “Kyoto Renascence”) and the feudal Lords Ogasawara Tadazana and Hosokawa Tadatoshi. Together with Hosokawa
              Lord, Musashi Sensei embraced in a very long and deep friendship.
            </p>
            <p>
              Musashi Sensei recalls on the Book of Five Rings that at his 50s he finally reached the full comprehension
              of
              the strategy. The level of understanding reached on the Way was so deep that, according with his words, he
              was
              able to “see” the Way in everything and on every detail of his life, from the time he waked up until he
              back
              to bed to sleep. Some of his paintings, sculptures and calligraphies masterpieces reached us nowadays. He
              reached the perfection on the Swordsmanship techniques and, thereafter, he was able to reach the same
              level of
              perfection in all of these Ways.
            </p>

            <h3 class="hright"><em>The Last Years of the Grand Master</em></h3>
            <p>
              The legacy Musashi Sensei left to the following generations was mainly focused on the Hyoho Niten Ichi
              Ryu,
              resulting from his life experience on combats and his deep life perception developed over decades of
              practicing and observation. In our School we follow the forms and positions (the katas) in the exact
              manner
              Musashi Sensei created long time ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Musashi Sensei spent the last years of his life in Kumamoto, as a guest of his fellow friend Hosokawa
              Tadatoshi. Thanks to a Lord Hosokawa request, Musashi Sensei registered his techniques and his thinking in
              a
              short article called “35 sections on the Art of Kenjutsu”. While in Kumamoto he taught the Hyoho Niten
              Ichi
              Ryu to his disciples and dedicated to study Buddhism, meditation and artistic development.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of his life Musashi Sensei lived as an eremite in the Reigando Sanctuary, where he dedicated to
              meditation and the constant practice of his style. He wrote the Book of Five Rings, leaving all the
              teachings
              to his disciple Terao Magonojo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Musashi Sensei died on May 19, 1645. He was buried (at his request) using a complete War Dress (yoroi
              armor)
              in the Yuji village, near to Iwato Mount. It is recalled that during his funeral services a hard lightning
              bolt stroke at the sky, as Gods were welcoming the Powerful Warrior.

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          In Musashi's last book, The Book of Five Rings (五輪書, Go Rin no Sho), Musashi seems to take a very
          philosophical approach to looking at the "craft of war": "There are five ways in which men pass through life:
          as gentlemen, warriors, farmers, artisans and merchants."
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the book, Musashi implies that the way of the Warrior, as well as the meaning of a "true
          strategist" is that of somebody who has made mastery of many art forms away from that of the sword, such as
          tea drinking (sadō), laboring, writing, and painting, as Musashi practiced throughout his life. Musashi
          was hailed as an extraordinary sumi-e artist in the use of ink monochrome as depicted in two such paintings:
          "Shrike Perched in a Dead Tree" (Koboku Meigekizu, 枯木鳴鵙図) and "Wild Geese Among Reeds" (Rozanzu, 魯山図). Going
          back to the Book of Five Rings, Musashi talks deeply about the ways of Buddhism.
        </p>
        <p>
          He makes particular note of artisans and foremen. When he wrote the book, the majority of houses in Japan were
          made of wood. In the use of building a house, foremen have to employ strategy based upon the skill and ability
          of their workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In comparison to warriors and soldiers, Musashi notes the ways in which the artisans thrive through events;
          the ruin of houses, the splendor of houses, the style of the house, the tradition and name or origins of a
          house. These too, are similar to the events which are seen to have warriors and soldiers thrive; the rise and
          fall of prefectures, countries and other such events are what make uses for warriors, as well as the literal
          comparisons: "The carpenter uses a master plan of the building, and the way of strategy is similar in that
          there is a plan of campaign".
        </p>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="philright">
            <img class="responsive" src="assets/images/musashi-med.webp" alt="Woodblock painting of Musashi">
          </div>
          <div class="philleft">
            <h3 class="hleft"><em>Way of Strategy</em></h3>
            <h4><em>Ni-Ten Ichi Ryu</em></h4>
            <p>
              Within the book, Musashi mentions that the use of two swords within strategy is equally beneficial to
              those
              who use the skill for individual duels or large engagements. The idea of using two hands for a sword is an
              idea that Musashi opposes because there is no fluidity in movement with two hands: "If you hold a sword
              with
              both hands, it is difficult to wield it freely to left and right, so my method is to carry the sword in
              one
              hand." He also disagrees with the idea of using a sword with two hands on a horse and/or riding on
              unstable
              terrain, such as muddy swamps, rice fields, or within crowds of people.
            </p>
            <p>
              To learn the strategy of Ni-Ten Ichi Ryū, Musashi asserts that by training with two long swords, one in
              each
              hand, one will be able to overcome the cumbersome nature of using a sword in both hands. Although it is
              difficult, Musashi agrees that there are times in which the long sword must be used with two hands, but
              one
              whose skill is good enough should not need it.
            </p>
            <p>
              After using two long swords proficiently enough, mastery of a long sword, and a "companion sword", most
              likely
              a wakizashi, will be much increased: "When you become used to wielding the long sword, you will gain the
              power
              of the Way and wield the sword well."
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, it could be seen, from the excerpts from The Book of Five Rings, that real strategy behind
              Ni-Ten No
              Ichi Ryu, is that there is no real iron-clad method, path, or type of weaponry specific to the style of
              Ni-Ten
              No Ichi Ryu:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>You can win with a long weapon, and yet you can also win with a short weapon. In short, the Way of the
                Ichi
                school is the spirit of winning, whatever the weapon and whatever its size.</em>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="philleft rowtwo" style="text-align: right;">
            <h3 class="hright"><em>Religion</em></h3>
            <p>
              Even from an early age, Musashi separated his religion from his involvement in swordsmanship. Excerpts
              such as
              the one below, from The Book of Five Rings, demonstrate a philosophy that is thought to have stayed with
              him
              throughout his life:

              <em>There are many ways: Confucianism, Buddhism, the ways of elegance, rice-planting, or dance; these
                things
                are
                not to be found in the way of the warrior.</em>

              However, the belief that Musashi disliked Shinto is inaccurate, as he criticises the Shintō-ryū style of
              swordsmanship, not Shinto, the religion. In Musashi's Dokkōdō, his stance on religion is further
              elucidated:
              "Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help."

          In his later years, Musashi said in his The Book of Five Rings: "When I apply the principle of strategy to the
          ways of different arts and crafts, I no longer have need for a teacher in any domain." He proved this by
          creating recognized masterpieces of calligraphy and classic ink painting. His paintings are characterized by
          skilled use of ink washes and an economy of brush stroke. He especially mastered the "broken ink" school of
          landscapes, applying it to other subjects, such as his Kobokumeikakuzu ("Shrike Perched on a Withered Branch";
          part of a triptych whose other two members were "Hotei Walking" and "Sparrow on Bamboo"), his Hotei Watching a
          Cockfight, and his Rozanzu ("Wild Geese Among Reeds"). The Book of Five Rings advocates involvement in
          calligraphy and other arts as a means of training in the art of war.

          Even in Musashi's time there were fictional texts resembling comic
          books. It is therefore quite difficult to separate fact from fiction
          when discussing his life. There have been numerous works of fiction
          made about or featuring Musashi. Eiji Yoshikawa's novelization
          (originally a 1930s daily newspaper serial) has greatly influenced
          successive fictional depictions (including the manga Vagabond by
          Takehiko Inoue) and is often mistaken for a factual account of
          Musashi's life. In 2012, writer Sean Michael Wilson and Japanese
          artist Chie Kutsuwada published an attempt at a more historically
          accurate manga entitled The Book of Five Rings: A Graphic Novel,
          based on research and translations by William Scott Wilson.

          Onimusha, a video game series by Capcom, featured Musashi as a
          secret playable character in Onimusha Blade Warriors.

          The 2008 video game Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan! was based on his life and personality.

          He also appeared in the manga Baki-Dou as a revived clone of himself
          with his real soul intact as one of the strongest fighters in the
          series, and used his two-sword style in almost every combat in which
          he was shown.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the video game Overwatch the playable character
          Genji used to have a voice line that quotes Musashi: "Mi wo sutetemo
          myōri wa sutezu" (身を捨てても名利は捨てず), which roughly
          translates to "You may abandon your body, but you must preserve your
          honor."
        </p>
        <p>
          The card game Magic: The Gathering has a card based on him,
          Isshin, Two Heavens as One, named for his two swords as one
          technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 2017 video game For Honor, the "Aramusha" hero is
          loosely inspired by Musashi. The character is a ronin who wields two
          swords.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Cyberpunk 2077 the character Takemura sends a text
          message to V that reads "Even should you abandon your body, never
          abandon your honor. Never stray from the Way. Miyamoto Musashi" This
          text can only be received after the mission Search and Destroy, if
          the player saves Takemura.
        </p>

          The 2023 anime Onimusha was based loosely
          on the video game franchise of the same name and produced by
          Netflix. The series portrays a fictional version of an aging Musashi
          who embarks on a journey to defeat supernatural forces of evil using
          the Oni Gauntlet.
